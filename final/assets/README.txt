ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project implements an interactive board game fashioned after the game
Candyland. This is a multiplayer game, and users will compete to make it to the Candy Castle first.
Users will encounter fun challanges and puzzles to solve along their journey. Participants can also
use their wit to slow their opponenets down by deploying candies with different effects.
