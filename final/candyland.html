        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Candyland is a multiplayer board game where players compete to reach the Candy Castle first while solving puzzles and using candies to strategically slow down opponents.

        <h2>Project Goal</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to recreate the classic Candyland board game as an
            interactive C++ program. I focused on building clear turn-based logic, using text
            files to drive the game setup, and creating a fun, replayable experience for
            multiple players.

        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed the game flow, including turn order, win conditions, and rules for special tiles.</li>
            <li>Implemented the core game logic in C++, including player movement, card drawing, and score tracking.</li>
            <li>Used external text files to store game messages and board information so the game could be updated without changing code.</li>
            <li>Tested gameplay, fixed logic bugs, and refined prompts to make the game easy to understand for new players.</li>
        </ul>
